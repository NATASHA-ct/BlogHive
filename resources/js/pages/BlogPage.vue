                Vaccination is the most
                effective way to protect against infectious diseases. Vaccines
                strengthen your immune system by training it to recognise and
                fight against specific viruses. When you get vaccinated, you are
                protecting yourself and helping to protect the whole community.
                <br><br>
                A COVID-19 vaccine might:
              <ul>
                <li> Prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from
                  becoming seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19 </li>
                <li>Prevent you from
                  spreading the COVID-19 virus to others </li>
                <li> Add to the number of people
                  in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 â€” making
                  it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd
                  immunity </li>
                <li> Prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and
                  replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more
                  resistant to vaccines</li>
              </ul>
